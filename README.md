[00:21.05] The world is spinning too fast
[00:23.63] I'm buying lead Nike shoes
[00:26.42] To keep myself tethered
[00:28.74] To the days I've tried to lose
[00:43.74] 
[00:31.70] My mama said to slow down
[00:34.10] You must make your own shoes
[00:36.91] Stop dancing to the music
[00:39.32] Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
[00:42.13] Keeping my groove on
[00:52.13] 
[00:44.29] Day doo de bop
[00:47.38] Day doo de bop
[00:50.27] Day doo de bop
[00:53.15] Day doo de bop
[00:55.70] Day doo de bop
[00:58.53] Day doo de bop
[01:01.14] Day doo de bop
[01:03.26] Day doo de bop
[01:10.26] 
[01:04.90] (Here you go)
[01:06.08] Get the cool
[01:08.50] Get the cool shoeshine
[01:11.29] Get the cool
[01:13.96] Get the cool shoeshine
[01:16.74] Get the cool
[01:19.29] Get the cool shoeshine
[01:22.09] Get the cool
[01:24.63] Get the cool shoeshine
[01:35.63] 
[01:43.50] There's a monkey in the jungle
[01:46.36] Watching a vapor trail
[01:49.19] Caught up in the conflict
[01:51.57] Between his brain and his tail
[02:06.57] 
[01:54.39] And if time's elimination
[01:57.04] Then we got nothing to lose
[01:59.60] Please repeat the message
[02:01.91] It's the music that we choose
[02:04.69] Keeping my groove on
[02:14.69] 
[02:05.91] Day doo de bop
[02:08.02] Day doo de bop
[02:10.50] Day doo de bop
[02:13.43] Day doo de bop
[02:16.25] Day doo de bop
[02:18.60] Day doo de bop
[02:21.12] Day doo de bop
